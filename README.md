## Text-Editor-using-dual-stack
#### Brief 
1. A Text Editor is a Simple Program for editing Plain text.
2. Using 2 stacks makes it more efficient to perform different operations
3. To just give a brief:\
● The two stacks are used to represent the contents where the cursor is.\
● One stack will represent all the contents left of the cursor while the other stack will represent all the contents right of the cursor.\
4. Hence, performing operations like insertion, deletion and replacement are achieved efficiently.

#### Design and Problem statement
- To create a Text editor implementing dual stack.

#### In this text editor we have implemented various functions, which are :
       1.Insert a character
       2.Insert a Word
       3.Backspace a character
       4.Delete a character
       5.Move cursor to left 
       6.Move cursor to right
       7.Move the cursor to a specified position
